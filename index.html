            <aside class="notes">
              <ul>
                <li>What does this mean?</li>
                <li>It means lack of scope. Global scope might be fine for a weekend project, but it's really going to get unbearable on a large project with dozens of devs and hundreds of views.</li>
                <li>It means confusion around which rules apply and which don't. How am I supposed to maintain something if I don't know what's going to happen if I change the code?</li>
                <li>The list goes on:</li>
                <li>It means dead code is hidden and lives around forever</li>
                <li>It means working with other people, including yourself, six months ago, is really, really hard.</li>
                <li>I'm preaching to the choir here, everyone here has fought with CSS.</li>
                <li>This is a very incomplete list - as we all knwo</li>

              <ul>
                <li>But I think that these distill the core problems for maintainable css at scale</li>
                <li>And if you look closely, you can see a common symptom</li>
                <li>Lack of scoping features leads to a global scope, leads to leaky code, inheritance problems, and specificity increases</li>
                <li>Confusing behaviour around how specificity, inheritance and the cascade works leads directly to specificity wars</li>
                <li>Specificity wars is the symptom of the worst parts of CSS.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>If we're talking about an optimal styling language, we would do very well to eliminate specificity wars, once and for all.</li>
                <li>It doesn't matter how much good practice you know — when you're in a specificity war, good practice goes out the window. We've all been there. We've all done that.</li>
                <li>Since this is such a core problem with CSS, since this touches on everything from the cascade, to selectors, to scope, to inheritance, solving this should solve a good chunk of our most fundamental CSS strifes.</li>
                <li>So now we know what our ideal styling language should solve, let's embark on our thought experiment...</li>

              <ul>
                <li>So Javascript for everything is not necessarily a bad thing. Except when it is.</li>

                <li>This separation of duties is crucial for accessibility, and hence the success of the web.</li>
                <li>So while javascript is great for now, we have to be careful what direction we're heading in in the future, and always bear in mind that accessibility is compulsory, not a nice to have.</li>

                <li>The cascade is powerful.</li>
                <li>CSS4 is exciting! Most of it is already implemented in Chrome and Firefox so unless you need to support IE/Edge, go nuts!</li>
                <li>I would be really intrigued to see what CSS could look like as a fully fledged functional programming language, but we're not there yet. So play around! Explore.</li>
                <li>BEM v Atomic</li>
                <li>To keep content, style and logic separate, we need good interfaces between them, so we don't just inline all our CSS or throw everything in Javascript. I dunno about you, but Barak's talk about Houdini API has got me very excited about the future.</li>

                <li>I started this thinking the massive problems around CSS must mean the need for massive change.</li>
                <li>I was wrong.</li>
                <li>A lot of the strange things that CSS does is based in good decisions and consideration for wider contexts than just web development.</li>
                <li>So maybe it's time to reignite our CSS love?</li>
                <li>Maybe, after all of our struggle and over-tooling and band-aiding, we can just appreciate CSS for what it is, and what it does</li>
                <li>And then we can make sure it keeps working, for us, and for the future of the web.</li>
